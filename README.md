In this overview I'll be explaing how my food app works and how to use it.

In this app we have used different kinds of functions to actually make our app work. We have what we call our variables as declaration for our buttons, our display and also for our textview.
These funtions they tell us what to do, what is happening and what we would see after we have done some engagements. 
Basically on our food app we learn how to order food using the app, so we have meal suggestions there, which they will pop up after you are done pressing the submit button according to your Time of day. 
We have the suggestion for your morning, mid-morning, afternoon, mid afternoon and for dinner time.

I am confident to say my app is fuctioning very well and every committed variables are not giving any problems.
